# Tech Stack â€“ Wrestling Journey PWA

This project is intentionally minimal and client-side only.

## Core Rules
- **No Node.js, no npm, no build tools**
- **No Tailwind, Bootstrap, or CSS frameworks**
- **No React, Vue, or other frameworks**
- **Static hosting only** (GitHub Pages)

## Allowed
- Pure **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **IndexedDB** + **localStorage** for persistence
- **Service Worker** for offline use
- **Vanilla CSS** (with gradients, transitions, custom properties)
- **Web APIs** (Clipboard, Date, etc.)

## Goal
Keep the app free, offline-first, and portable. All enhancements must respect these constraints.
